Realizing his impairment is the reason he is not getting anywhere in his life, Ravi plans to start his own business and overcome it. He seeks his parents' financial aid for the same, but his hope gets dashed once again as the conversation ends in another fight between his parents. That's when Parvatham approaches him again for the idol, offering him a tidy sum in return. She also tempts him, saying that he could travel abroad with the money she gives him and treat his night blindness effectively. Naturally, this entices Ravi, and some plans start emerging in his mind.

In the meantime, due to many inauspicious incidents and endless obstacles hitting the family's peaceful life, Gomathi's family conducts a Kavidi prashnam under the supervision of their family astrologer. In the Kavidi prashnam, it is suggested that the only way to end their bad luck is to move the Ganesha idol back to the family temple. Gomathi, who has a blind belief in such matters, agrees to do it in no time. When Gomathi informs Ravi about these new turns of events, Ravi's dreams surrounding the idol get shattered. Ravi steals the Ganesha idol from his mother's bedroom on that rainy night. He hides it in his cousin's old car lying unwanted outside their house for ages.

Ravi tries to contact Parvatham to sell the stolen idol, but he can't reach her. Since he has no information about her whereabouts, Ravi falls into total crisis. In that desperation, Ravi contacts Charles, a pickpocket from the Vaathuruthi colony, whom he met at the police station a few days ago. After listening to Ravi's problems, Charles unconditionally agrees to help him out. So Ravi and Charles venture out to find an appropriate place to sell the idol. They go to many shops and centres of Kochi where such fraudulent activities take place. This journey develops a deep friendship between them.

Charles' company reinstates Ravi's lost confidence and positivity. After passing through many struggles and days of tense moments, Charles and Ravi finally sell the idol, which also brings Gomathi's ideas about God to new heights. With the money he earns from the Ganesha idol, Ravi starts a shop selling idols.
